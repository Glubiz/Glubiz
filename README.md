# Hi there, I'm Jonathan Solskov! 👋

I'm a Developer at CEGO A/S, where I develop and maintain a system responsible for marketing consent and 3rd party integrations with SendGrid, Trustpilot, and Ortto.

## Education

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology from Aalborg University, where I gained a strong foundation in software development, computer networks, and systems engineering.

## My Interests

I have a strong interest in web3 and blockchain technologies, and I'm always exploring new ways to build innovative and decentralized solutions.

## Languages & Tools

At CEGO, I primarily work with Laravel for developing and maintaining backend systems. In my side projects, I use Rust for both frontend and backend development, leveraging its unique features to build high-quality, efficient, and maintainable software.
